## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project I applied what I learned in HTML and CSS of the program, implementing them in an effective way and using flexbox for a more dynamic and personalized design.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<div class="images">
      <div class="image first">
        <div class="photo-name">
          <img src="images/photo_1.png" alt="Bill Mahoney">
          <div class="rol">Product Owner</div>
        </div>
        <div class="name">Bill Mahoney</div>
      </div>
    </div>
```
```css
.images {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
    width: 30%;
    padding: 0;
    box-sizing: border-box;
    /* Incluye padding en el ancho total */
  }

```


### Continued development

For future projects, I will focus on image optimization to ensure fast loading times. I'll also explore more about implementing CSS to improve the user experience.
